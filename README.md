<h1>Chat App</h1>

This App allows users to create an account and help them send messages between one another.

<h2>Installation</h2>

$git clone https://github.com/fouchimi/ChatApp.git

On Linux and Mac OS, you can open the project on Android Studio and run ./gradlew assembleDebug and adb -d install app/{path-to-your-apk} which is often app/build/outputs/apk/{apk_file}.

On Windows, you can run this command instead gradle.bat assembleDebug and adb -d install app/{path-to-your-apk}

Alternatively you can simply click on the run button of the IDE and those steps will be ran automatically and load the application on your mobile or virtual device
